		<h2>1. Storage Drive</h2>	
		<p>
			In this Computer Aided Design project, I created the design of a storage drive matching the manufacturer specifications.<br>
			The storage drive has an outer casing and an inner body.<br>
			The outer casing is made of sheet metal with bending and forming operations performed on it. <br>
			<img src="images/storagedrive1.jpeg" alt="storagedrive-img" class="storagedrive1"><br>
			The above image is the isometric view of the storage drive assembly.<br>
			The inner body is latched on to the outer casing at one end.<br>
			<img src="images/storagedrive2.jpeg" alt="storagedriveexplodedview-img" class="storagedrive2"><br>
			The above image is the exploded view of the storage drive assembly.<br>
			The CAD models of both the inner body and the outer casing are made to scale.<br> 
			Both the models can be easily converted into a high-fidelity prototype using SLA or FDM printers.<br>
			The outer casing model can be easily converted into g-code programming and can be loaded into the laser cutting machine for sheet metal operation.<br>
