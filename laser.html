		<h2>4. Laser Light Gun</h2>	
		<p>
			In this Computer Aided Design project, I created the design of a laser light gun assembly matching the manufacturer specifications.<br>
			The laser light gun assembly has multiple parts which are assembled together to form a single unit.<br>
			All the components in the assembly are made out of metal.<br>
			<img src="images/laser1.jpg" alt="laser-img" class="laser1"><br>
			The above image is the isometric view of the laser light gun assembly.<br>
			The assembly components can be screwed on together with the threads provided on the individual components.<br>
			<img src="images/laser2.jpg" alt="laser-img" class="laser2"><br>
			All CAD models of every component in the assembly are made to scale.<br>
			All the components of the model can be easily converted into a high-fidelity prototype and a final manufacturing product using SLA or FDM printers.<br>
			The components can also be assembled together easily to test the fit and form of the assembly.<br>
			When the laser diode and its power source are assembled into the product, functional capability of the product can be tested.<br>
