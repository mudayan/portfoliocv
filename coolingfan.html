		<h2>3. Cooling Fan</h2>	
		<p>
			In this Computer Aided Design project, I created the design of a cooling fan assembly matching the manufacturer specifications.<br>
			The cooling fan assembly has multiple parts which are assembled together to form a single unit.<br>
			All the components in the assembly are made out of plastic.<br>
			<img src="images/coolingfan1.JPG" alt="coolingfan-img" class="coolingfan1"><br>
			The above image is the isometric view of the cooling fan assembly.<br>
			The assembly components can be screwed on together using standard screws available in the market.<br>
			<img src="images/coolingfan2.JPG" alt="coolingfan-img" class="coolingfan2"><br>
			The above image is the outer casing of the cooling fan assembly.<br>
			All CAD models of every component in the assembly are made to scale.<br>
			<img src="images/coolingfan3.JPG" alt="coolingfan-img" class="coolingfan3"><br>
			The above image is the rotary component of the cooling fan assembly.<br>
			All the components of the model can be easily converted into a high-fidelity prototype and a final manufacturing product using SLA or FDM printers.<br>
			The components can also be assembled together easily to test the fit and form of the assembly.<br>
			When a two phase brushless motor is connected to the rotary component with wiring, the product can be tested for its functional capability.<br>
