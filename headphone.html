		<h2>2. Headphone</h2>	
		<p>
			In this Computer Aided Design project, I created the design of a headphone assembly matching the manufacturer specifications.<br>
			The headphone assembly has multiple parts which are assembled together to form a single unit.<br>
			The assembly is an mixture of different materials such as fabric, metal and plastic.<br>

			The above image is the isometric view of the headphone assembly.<br>
			The assembly has multiple components which latch with the other and forms an adjustable unit.<br>
			<img src="images/headphone1.jpeg" alt="headphone-img" class="headphone1"><br>
			The above image is the front view of the headphone assembly.<br>
			All CAD models of every component in the assembly are made to scale.<br>
			<img src="images/headphone3.jpeg" alt="headphone-img" class="headphone3"><br>
			All the components of the model can be easily converted into a high-fidelity prototype using SLA or FDM printers.<br>
			The prototype components can also be assembled together easily to test the fit, form and partial function of the assembly.<br>
